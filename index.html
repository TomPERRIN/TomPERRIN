                        <p>During the 4 years of my computer science degree, I learned C, Java, Python, JS, SQL, HTML, algorithmics, optimisation, graph theory. But I wanted to get closer to the hardware, so I decided to do a master degree in embedded systems.
                            That's where I programed on microcontrollers (arduino, STM32), and learned how to code in C++, VHDL, but also did image and video treatments (global and local) and went further in ai programming with deepLearning courses.</p>

                        <p>I could be eating seeds as a pastime activity, but I preferred to play music, starting with the saxophone for 4 years, then falling in love with the drums for 3 years, after which I no longer had the opportunity to play. That's
                            why, 3 years later, I found myself a place in a batucada troupe, where I was able to take up percussion and music again.

                            I climbed with friends just as a sport hangout but I imediatly fell in love with it. For now I've only cimbed in indoor climbing gym, but I'm looking forward to climb in the nature. I now do it 2 to 3 times a week and I'm not willing to stop.

                                The goal of this project was to create a software that could manage airline reservations from customers, but also manage the flights and the planes of each companies. Following rules of information spreading amongst every "objects" as it was in Java(mandatory),
                                and manage the possible illogicals events.

                            <p>By groups, we were given the choice of the programming langage. We then chose Java. We had to simulate the growth of a rabit population based on probability, then run long simulations a large number of time, to extract the
                                desired information such as the death rate, the average time before the population stabilizes, the average population at stabilization, and more.
